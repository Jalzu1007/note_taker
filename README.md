## Description

The Note Taker application is a web-based tool that allows users to write and save notes. It provides a simple and organized way to keep track of tasks, thoughts, and ideas. The application utilizes an Express.js back end and stores and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The motivation behind building this project was to create a practical application that helps small business owners or individuals stay organized and manage their notes effectively. By providing a user-friendly interface and seamless functionality, the Note Taker application aims to improve productivity and enhance note-taking experiences.

Through this project, I learned how to use Express.js to create a back end for a web application. I also gained experience in working with JSON files, handling HTTP requests (GET and POST), and deploying an application to Heroku.
